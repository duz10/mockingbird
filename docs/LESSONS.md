## 2026-05-15 [bootstrap] bd (beads) lives next to STATUS.md, not instead of it
- **Context:** PLAN.md predates the decision to adopt `bd` for issue
  tracking. User asked during bootstrap if we were using beads.
- **Finding:** `bd` is the live, dependency-graph-aware task queue; STATUS.md
  is the human-readable phase snapshot the PLAN, judges, and hooks expect
  at iteration boundaries. They serve complementary roles — keep both in
  sync end-of-iteration.
- **Action:** Every iteration: `bd close <completed-ids>`, `bd create` for
  discovered work, AND update STATUS.md.

## 2026-05-15 [bootstrap] bd init is interactive and will timeout in a non-TTY
- **Context:** `bd init --prefix mb` ran for >60s because it prompted
  "Contributing to someone else's repo? [y/N]".
- **Finding:** The initial run *did* create `.beads/` before timing out;
  re-running fails because it sees the partial state.
- **Action:** Pipe `"N"` (PowerShell `'N' |`) to skip the prompt, or use a
  `--non-interactive` flag if/when bd adds one. If init is partial, just
  proceed with `bd status` — the partial state is usable.

## 2026-05-15 [bootstrap] PowerShell + native CLIs treat stderr as terminating
- **Context:** `bd create` emits a one-line warning to stderr
  ("beads.role not configured"); with `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"`
  PowerShell threw on the first call.
- **Finding:** PS 7's `$PSNativeCommandUseErrorActionPreference = $false`
  is the right escape hatch for native-command stderr noise.
- **Action:** In any PS script that wraps native CLIs, set
  `$PSNativeCommandUseErrorActionPreference = $false` at the top.

## 2026-05-15 [bootstrap] Hook scripts must decode subprocess stdout themselves on Windows
- **Context:** `session-start-briefing.py` crashed with cp1252 UnicodeDecodeError
  when reading `bd ready` output (em-dashes were not cp1252-encodable).
- **Finding:** `subprocess.run(..., text=True)` uses the locale codec on
  Windows (cp1252), not UTF-8.
- **Action:** Always pass `capture_output=True` without `text=True`, then
  decode `.stdout` as `utf-8, errors='replace'`. The shared
  `scripts/hooks/_lib.py` has examples.

## 2026-05-15 [phase-0] rust-toolchain.toml is a PIN, not an MSRV declaration
- **Context:** Added `rust-toolchain.toml` with `channel = "1.77"` thinking
  it would declare the project's MSRV. The next `rustc --version` call
  triggered rustup to install Rust 1.77 (a downgrade from the dev's
  installed 1.93), hanging the whole shell for ~40s.
- **Finding:** `rust-toolchain.toml` is a hard pin — rustup auto-installs
  the channel on *any* cargo/rustc invocation in that directory. MSRV
  (minimum supported) is a separate concept and belongs in
  `Cargo.toml`'s `[package] rust-version = "..."` field.
- **Action:** Do NOT commit `rust-toolchain.toml` unless you genuinely
  want every developer on the same exact Rust version. For "works on
  1.77+", use `rust-version = "1.77"` in `Cargo.toml` (added in Phase 1).
  Side lesson: `Get-Command rustc` in PowerShell will also block on the
  toolchain auto-install — diagnosis was confusing because the hang
  surfaces as a `Get-Command` hang, not a `rustup install` log.

## 2026-05-15 [bootstrap] Secret-scan hook needs a known-public-prefix allowlist
- **Context:** The Tauri updater public key in STATUS.md tripped the
  high-entropy heuristic in `block-secret-commit.py` (152-char base64 token).
- **Finding:** Public keys are *intended* to be in repos; scanning them as
  secrets is a false positive. Cleanest fix: an allowlist of well-known
  public-material prefixes (`dW50cnVzdGVkIGNvbW1lbnQ6` = Tauri/minisign,
  PEM `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----`, `ssh-rsa `, etc.) plus an inline pragma
  `pragma: allow-secret-scan` for human-vetted edge cases.
- **Action:** When adding a new "secrets you intentionally commit"
  category, extend `KNOWN_PUBLIC_PREFIXES` in `scripts/hooks/block-secret-commit.py`
  with a comment justifying the prefix. Never disable the high-entropy
  check wholesale.

## 2026-05-15 [bootstrap] PowerShell param defaults can't use $PSScriptRoot
- **Context:** `scripts/seed-judges.ps1` set a default param to
  `Join-Path $PSScriptRoot ...`; PS evaluates defaults before binding
  $PSScriptRoot, so the path was empty.
- **Finding:** Compute path defaults in the *body* of the script, not in
  the `param()` block. Also: `Join-Path` is two-arg only —
  `[IO.Path]::Combine(...)` is the n-arg version.
- **Action:** Pattern: `param([string]$X = "")` + `if (-not $X) { $X = ... }`.

## 2026-05-15 [phase-1] cargo fmt fights git autocrlf on Windows
- **Context:** Phase 1 Wave 1 first `cargo fmt --check` failed:
  `Incorrect newline style in src-tauri/src/lib.rs` even though the files
  were written with LF.
- **Finding:** Git's Windows default `core.autocrlf=true` converts LF to
  CRLF on checkout. rustfmt with `newline_style = "Unix"` then reads back
  CRLF and fails. The two settings fight each other.
- **Action:** Drop `newline_style` from `.rustfmt.toml` (default = Auto,
  accepts file as-is). Add `.gitattributes` with `*.rs text eol=lf` to
  pin LF cross-platform on next checkout. gitattributes is the single
  source of truth; rustfmt becomes ending-agnostic.

## 2026-05-15 [phase-1] rustup minimal toolchains do not include rustfmt or clippy
- **Context:** Fresh Rust install attempting `cargo fmt` produced
  `cargo-fmt.exe is not installed for the toolchain stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.
- **Finding:** rustup ships only the compiler by default; rustfmt and
  clippy are components, not bundled.
- **Action:** Always `rustup component add rustfmt clippy` as part of
  dev setup. Phase 1 Wave 5 task `p1-lefthook-verify` should add this
  to `setup-dev.ps1`.

## 2026-05-15 [phase-1] First cargo check with rusqlite-bundled takes ~4 minutes
- **Context:** First `cargo check --workspace` after Phase 1 Wave 1.
- **Finding:** 247 seconds (4m07s) cold-cache. `rusqlite` features=["bundled"]
  compiles SQLite from C source (~150k lines). One-time cost; incremental
  builds are seconds.
- **Action:** Budget the cold compile when planning iterations on a
  fresh checkout. CI should cache `target/` aggressively. Do NOT panic
  when cargo check appears to hang for 3-4 minutes on a fresh clone.
